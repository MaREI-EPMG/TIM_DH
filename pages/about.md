1. Biodiesel came in too strong in 2019 in the residential sector. From 2021 onwards, the increase is slow as per max growth starting in 2021 - this will be amended in the next update. 
2. CCS comes in very strong in 2040 - with no CCS, the model could not find a solution. 
3. Differences in house stock per scenario to be investigated. 
4. "PWR_Gen_HETC" is missing in the current results. The DH is oversupplied from Data centres; this graph will be added to the next iteration of results.
